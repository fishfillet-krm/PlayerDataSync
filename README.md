A comprehensive Bukkit/Spigot plugin for Minecraft **1.8 to 26.3** that synchronizes player data across multiple servers using MySQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL databases. Perfect for multi-server networks with BungeeCord or Velocity.

Player inventories, experience, health, achievements, economy balance, and more are stored in a shared database whenever they leave a server and restored when they join again.

## ✨ Features

- **Full Player Data Sync**: Inventory, EnderChest, Armor, Offhand, Experience, Health, Hunger, Potion Effects
- **Multi-Server Support**: Shared database across multiple servers (BungeeCord/Velocity compatible)
- **Economy Integration**: Vault economy balance synchronization
- **Achievements & Statistics**: Sync player advancements and statistics
- **Respawn to Lobby**: Automatically send players to lobby server after death/respawn
- **Version Compatibility**: Supports Minecraft 1.8 - 26.2 with automatic feature detection
- **Performance Optimized**: Async operations, connection pooling, batch processing
- **Management GUI**: Interactive menu for toggling sync options (`/sync menu`)
- **Maintenance Mode**: Globally pause syncing for safe maintenance (`/sync maintenance`)
- **Performance Profiling**: Detailed tracking of save/load times (`/sync profile`)
- **Database Support**: MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL

## 📋 Supported Versions

This plugin supports Minecraft versions **1.8 to 26.3**. Some features are automatically disabled on older versions:
- **Offhand sync**: Requires 1.9+
- **Attribute sync**: Requires 1.9+
- **Advancement sync**: Requires 1.12+

The plugin automatically detects the server version and enables/disables features accordingly.

### Respawn to Lobby Feature

The Respawn to Lobby feature automatically sends players to a designated lobby server after they die and respawn. This is perfect for game servers where players should return to a hub after death.

**Requirements:**
- BungeeCord or Velocity integration must be enabled
- The lobby server name must match the server name in your proxy configuration

**Configuration:**
```yaml
respawn_to_lobby:
  enabled: true         # Enable the feature
  server: lobby         # Server name from your proxy config
```

## 🔨 Building

This project uses Maven. To build the plugin:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DerGamer009/PlayerDataSync.git
cd PlayerDataSync

# Build for default version (1.21)
mvn clean package

# Build for specific Minecraft version
mvn clean package -Pmc-1.8    # Minecraft 1.8 (Java 8)
mvn clean package -Pmc-1.9    # Minecraft 1.9-1.16 (Java 8)
mvn clean package -Pmc-1.17   # Minecraft 1.17 (Java 16)
mvn clean package -Pmc-1.18   # Minecraft 1.18-1.20 (Java 17)
mvn clean package -Pmc-1.21   # Minecraft 1.21+ (Java 21)
mvn clean package -Pmc-26.3   # Minecraft 26.3 (Java 25)
```

The resulting jar file will be in the `target/` directory.

The build process uses Maven Shade plugin to bundle required dependencies directly into the final jar, so no additional libraries need to be installed on the server.

## 🔧 Multi-Server Setup (BungeeCord/Velocity)

To use PlayerDataSync across multiple servers:

1. **Configure the same database** on all servers
2. **Enable BungeeCord/Velocity integration** in `config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   integrations:
     bungeecord: true
   ```
3. **Set unique server IDs** for each server (optional, defaults to "default"):
   ```yaml
   server:
     id: survival    # Different ID for each server
   ```
4. **Enable server switching autosave**:
   ```yaml
   autosave:
     on_server_switch: true
   ```

The plugin will automatically save player data when they switch servers and restore it when they join a new server.

## ⚠️ Performance Considerations

### Achievement Synchronization

If you experience server freezing or lag when players join, it may be caused by achievement synchronization. The plugin includes automatic protection, but you should:

1. **Set `performance.disable_achievement_sync_on_large_amounts: true`** in config.yml
2. **Consider setting `sync.achievements: false`** if problems persist
3. **Monitor server logs** for timeout warnings

For servers with many achievements (1500+), the plugin automatically:
- Disables sync if too many achievements exist
- Processes achievements in batches
- Loads asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread

### Recommended Performance Settings

```yaml
performance:
  connection_pooling: true
  async_loading: true
  disable_achievement_sync_on_large_amounts: true
  achievement_batch_size: 50
  achievement_timeout_ms: 5000
  max_achievements_per_player: 2000
```

### Disabling Achievement Sync

If you experience performance issues, you can disable achievement synchronization entirely:

```yaml
sync:
  achievements: false  # Disable achievement sync to prevent lag
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Fixed Issues

- ✅ **Issue #45 - XP Sync**: Fixed experience synchronization not working across versions 1.8-1.26.2
- ✅ **Issue #46 - Vault Balance de-sync**: Fixed economy balance not being saved on server shutdown

### Troubleshooting

**Server Freezing:**
1. Set `sync.achievements: false` in config.yml
2. Enable performance settings (see above)
3. Check server logs for timeout warnings

**Economy Balance Not Syncing:**
1. Ensure Vault and an economy plugin are installed
2. Check that `sync.economy: true` in config.yml
3. Verify Vault integration is enabled: `integrations.vault: true`

**Players Not Switching Servers:**
1. Enable BungeeCord/Velocity integration: `integrations.bungeecord: true`
2. Verify server names match your proxy configuration
3. Check that `autosave.on_server_switch: true` is enabled

**Data Not Syncing:**
1. Verify database connection settings
2. Check server logs for database errors
3. Ensure all servers use the same database
4. Verify server IDs are set correctly (if using multiple servers)

## 📝 Version Compatibility

### Tested Versions
- ✅ **Minecraft 1.8 - 26.3**: Full compatibility with automatic feature detection
- ✅ **Paper 1.20.4 - 26.3**: Full compatibility
- ✅ **Spigot 1.8 - 26.3**: Full compatibility

### Compatibility Settings

```yaml
